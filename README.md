# Ph채notyp
by bewegende Architektur e.U.  
with support from Karl Deix  

Ph채notyp is an Add-On for Blender 3D  
https://www.blender.org/

It allows to perform genetic mutation of architectural structures. Furthermore it can be used to analyze moving shapes. This is especially useful when working on kinematic architectural projects. The tool is focusing on early stages of the design process and can be used for free without any warranty. If you want to participate in the project please get in contact via:

Analysis is done with PyNite from JWock82 (Craig):
